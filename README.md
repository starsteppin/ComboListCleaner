## üìñ How to Use ComboClean Pro (Detailed)

### What You Need Before Starting:
- A `.txt` file with email:password combinations
- Each line should look like: `email@domain.com:password123`
- File can be any size (we'll handle it!)

### Step-by-Step Cleaning Process:

#### Step 1: Upload Your File
1. **Find the Upload Section:** Look for a box that says "Browse" or "Choose File"
2. **Click "Browse":** This opens your file explorer
3. **Find Your File:** Navigate to where your combo list is saved
4. **Select the File:** Click on your `.txt` file once
5. **Click "Open":** Your file is now loaded!

**What happens:** The app reads your file and shows you basic information like:
- Number of lines in your file
- File size
- Estimated processing time

#### Step 2: Choose Your Cleaning Options
You'll see several checkboxes. Here's what each one does:

**üîÑ Remove Duplicates** ‚úÖ *Always recommended*
- Finds lines that are exactly the same
- Keeps only one copy of each unique entry
- Example: If `john@email.com:pass123` appears 5 times, keep only 1

**‚úÖ Validate Format** ‚úÖ *Always recommended*
- Checks that each line has the proper `email:password` format
- Removes lines that don't match this pattern
- Example: Removes lines like `just-some-text` or `email-without-colon`

**üè∑Ô∏è Filter by Domain** ‚ö†Ô∏è *Optional - Use carefully*
- Only keeps emails from specific domains
- Example: If you type "gmail.com", only Gmail addresses are kept
- **Warning:** This removes ALL other domains!

**üßπ Remove Empty Lines** ‚úÖ *Always recommended*
- Removes blank lines and lines with just spaces
- Makes your final file cleaner

#### Step 3: Start Processing
1. **Check Your Options:** Make sure you've selected what you want
2. **Click "Start Cleaning":** The big blue button
3. **Watch the Progress:** You'll see:
   - A progress bar showing completion percentage
   - Real-time statistics (lines processed, duplicates found, etc.)
   - Estimated time remaining

#### Step 4: Download Your Clean File
1. **Processing Complete:** When done, you'll see a "Download" button
2. **Click "Download":** Your browser will download the cleaned file
3. **Find Your File:** Check your Downloads folder
4. **File Name:** Usually named something like `cleaned_combo_list.txt`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Problems

### Problem: "File Won't Upload"
**Possible Causes & Solutions:**
- **Wrong file type:** Make sure your file ends in `.txt`
- **File too large:** Try with a smaller test file first
- **File is corrupted:** Try opening the file in a text editor first
- **Browser issue:** Try refreshing the page and uploading again

### Problem: "Processing Takes Forever"
**Solutions:**
- **Large files are slow:** Files over 100MB can take several minutes
- **Close other browser tabs:** Frees up memory for processing
- **Use a modern browser:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge work best
- **Don't close the tab:** Let it finish processing

### Problem: "Can't Download Results"
**Solutions:**
- **Check browser settings:** Make sure downloads aren't blocked
- **Allow pop-ups:** Some browsers block automatic downloads
- **Clear browser cache:** Sometimes helps with download issues
- **Try a different browser:** As a last resort

### Problem: "Results Look Wrong"
**Check These Things:**
- **Review your options:** Did you accidentally filter by domain?
- **Check original file:** Make sure your input file was formatted correctly
- **Understand the cleaning:** Duplicates and invalid formats are supposed to be removed

### Problem: "App Won't Start"
**On Replit:**
- Click the "Run" button again
- If still not working, fork the project again

**On Your Computer:**
- Make sure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Try deleting `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again
- Check that you're in the right folder: `ls` (Mac/Linux) or `dir` (Windows)

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Before You Start:
1. **Make a backup:** Always keep a copy of your original file
2. **Test with small files:** Try a 100-line file first to understand the process
3. **Check file format:** Open your file in a text editor to make sure it looks right
4. **Name files clearly:** Use descriptive names like `combo_list_Jan2024.txt`

### During Processing:
1. **Don't close the browser tab:** This will stop the processing
2. **Don't upload another file:** Wait for current processing to finish
3. **Watch the statistics:** They help you understand what's happening
4. **Be patient:** Large files take time, but it's worth the wait

### After Processing:
1. **Check the results:** Open the downloaded file to verify it looks good
2. **Compare statistics:** Make sure the numbers make sense
3. **Keep organized:** Store cleaned files in a dedicated folder
4. **Document changes:** Keep notes about what cleaning options you used

## üîí Privacy & Security (Why This is Safe)

### Your Data Never Leaves Your Computer
**How We Protect You:**
- ‚úÖ **No Upload to Servers:** Files are processed entirely in your browser
- ‚úÖ **No Data Storage:** Nothing is saved on our servers
- ‚úÖ **No Internet Required:** Works offline after the page loads
- ‚úÖ **No Registration:** No accounts, emails, or personal information needed
- ‚úÖ **No Tracking:** We don't monitor what you do or what files you process

### What This Means:
- **Government agencies can't access your data** (because we don't have it)
- **Hackers can't steal your data** (because it's not stored anywhere)
- **Company employees can't see your data** (because it never reaches us)
- **Internet outages don't affect processing** (once the page loads)

### How to Verify This is True:
1. **Disconnect from internet** after the page loads - it still works!
2. **Check browser developer tools** - no network requests during processing
3. **Review the code** - it's all open source, you can see exactly what it does

### On a Computer (Best Experience):
- **Windows:** Works in Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **Mac:** Works in Safari, Chrome, Firefox
- **Linux:** Works in Firefox, Chrome
- **Memory:** 4GB RAM recommended for large files
- **Storage:** Minimal space needed (just for downloads)

## üéì Advanced Tips for Power Users

### File Size Guidelines:
- **Small (< 1MB):** Instant processing, works on any device
- **Medium (1-10MB):** Few seconds, works on most devices
- **Large (10-50MB):** 30 seconds to 2 minutes, needs good computer
- **Very Large (50-200MB):** 2-10 minutes, needs powerful computer
- **Massive (> 200MB):** May take 10+ minutes or crash browser

### Performance Optimization:
1. **Close unnecessary browser tabs** (frees memory)
2. **Close other programs** while processing large files
3. **Use incognito/private mode** (fewer browser extensions interfering)
4. **Process during off-peak hours** (when computer isn't busy)

### Batch Processing Strategy:
If you have multiple files:
1. **Process one at a time** (don't open multiple tabs)
2. **Start with smallest files** (to test settings)
3. **Use consistent naming** (clean_file_001.txt, clean_file_002.txt, etc.)
4. **Document your settings** (write down which options you used)
